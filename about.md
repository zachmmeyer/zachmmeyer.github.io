I'm Zach. I have too many interests and not enough time, so I'm making more time.

### More Information

I want to get a deeper understanding of Computer Science. I want to make applications for people that make their lives better. I also shamefully want to make interactive experiences in the form of video games. I want to at least properly learn to play piano.

I'm hoping that my interesting philosophy towards making and selling software will get me somewhere in life. I gotta afford to live too.

### Contact me

I don't have a good email to use yet, sorry.
