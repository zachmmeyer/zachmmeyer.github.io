## I'm back on my bullshit

Last time I tried to *take a break* it honestly didn't go too bad. I planned for six weeks and made it a decently long way, but the problem is I added more and more criteria along the way and restricted myself too harshly. So to explain what I *plan* to restrict I'd like to explain the things I want to accomplish consistently that I'm not currently.

## Stuff I want to do

### Study

Studying can be anywhere from self learning with technical textbooks to preparing for an exam to reading an RPG book. Some of these things are more important than the other, but a lot of people can squeeze all of these events into their schedule.

### Read books

Reading is good for you. I'm not talking about easily digestable media, I'm referring to the more difficult stuff. Books about science, philosophy, sustainability. Reading about other peoples lives. Fiction isn't bad for you persay but it can be closer to junk food if you're not careful.

### Just in general do the things I want to do that I don't

Sleep enough, exercise, spend time with people I care about, and make progress in my goals.

## Stuff I don't want to do as much

### The Parasocial Network

For me at least what I've done is make up for the lack of real deep relationships by spreading myself thin in different online communities. The communities are mostly behind content creators who have zero interest in being anywhere near their communities. Having these communities checks off a box for them and gives their fans a place to explode quietly while also be "near" the important person. I agree that these VIPs do not owe their fans anything other than to provide more content for the machine, but they contribute to said machine and the machine is disgusting. I also still hate the idea of pulling the slot machine level in the hopes of finding more high quality communities with mind numbing content for me to ingest.

### The Eternal Noise

All of the content, videos, podcasts, music, everything that you can blast into your eyes and ears, it takes a massive toll on my brain. When I turn the fans off in my room and sit in silence, the lack of noise is *outstandingly comforting*. The problem is my grey matter is hardwired to be stimulated from the moment I wake up until the moment I pass out from exhaustion.

### The Backlog

It is easier than ever to accumulate a nigh endless videogame library, legally, for free. Multiple distributors give away games weekly. As of writing this I have at least 500+ hours worth of games install on my desktop. I have all of these icons organized on my desktop in some sort of order and area indiciating genre and priority. Every time I look at my desktop it is a reminder of not having enough time to indulge in that specific digital entertainment because it has a higher barrier to entry vs "opening YouTube and finding a video" or "scrolling on BlueSky". Why should I play WereCleaner 100% that takes a few hours when I can watch someone else do it in 37 minutes? Their commentary is better than mine, they're better at the game than I am, and now it's one less game I want to play. I am conflicted. Should I experience this myself? Should I get second-hand enjoyment? Clearly I feel some level of guilt and shame.

### Itadakimasu

Like how easy it is to build a videogame library that you will never finished, there is also another form of content that creates more than you will ever be able to complete: manga. Endless chapters of all kinds of genres of people living lives you wish you could. I really try to pride myself in not taking in the *sad* genres like isekai and other ones I don't want to mention. I stick to more mature themes but also go with slice of life. These peoples lives are interesting and typically favorable. But then there are the crazy action adventure ones that get unbelievably messed up, those are fun too. But it is endless, my backlog is nigh endless. I have read so many excellent stories, as well as ones I wish I could scrub from my brain.

## The plan

Do less of the things I feel bad about and replace them with the things I'd feel good about. Do it for a short amount of time. Re-evaluate. Repeat.

Less:
- Social Media
- Short/long form video/audio content
- Music
- Solo video games
- Fictional reading

More:
- Same time wake/sleep time daily (within reason on sleep because of work and occasional social time, but no budge on wake)
- Daily yoga
- Daily elliptical heart rate training
- Every other day lifting
- Breath focus meditative session, daily, 30 minutes minimum, any time of the day but preferably before bed
- Outside time, daily, 20 minutes minimum, any time of the day but preferably in the sun

I am hoping that this is enough of a good start. I feel like this is a better plan than last time. I am leaving myself social gaming time with friends when I can have it. I want to be good with watching the occasional movie or tv show with my wife. And I want to train my brain to crave fake social garbage that is endlessly supplied in the worst fucking way possible. Fuck the machine.
